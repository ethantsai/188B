In particular, it allows one to quickly run code snippets independently from one another.  If you've every used a Mathematica notebook, then jupyter notebook functionality will feel quite natural and familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are organized by **cells**.  Each cell can either contain code that one wants to run, or text one might want to use to say offer an explanation of the code.  Each cell starts as a coding cell by default.  To change the character of a cell one can enter **command mode** by pressing the [Esc] key.  Once you've pressed [Esc] to enter command mode, you can change the character of the cell by pressing another key right afterward.  For example, if you want to write text or mathematics as an explanation, then you can press the [m] key after having entered command mode.  This will change the cell to a **markdown** cell.  Markdown is a language for writing text. If you want to see an example of markdown syntax, double click on this cell which is itself a markdown cell, and you'll be able to see that, for example, headings are written by putting `#` characters before them, and boldfaced text is obtained with double asterisks.\n",

When a variable is assigned a value, you're telling the interpreter to associate the symbol with the specified value that's stored somewhere in memory.  For example, in the case in the exercise above, the variable `x` was first assigned the integer value `13`, so that integer is stored in memory somewhere, and the interpreter points the variable `x` to that location in memory.  In fact, you can even find the memory address where that variable value is being stored with the built-in Python function `id()`.  For example, when I execute the code \n",

    "    x = 13\n",

    "```\n",
    "    139819098501312\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x -> 139819098501312 (the location in memory where 3 was stored)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next line, `y = x`, we are telling the interpreter to assign `y` to the same value as `x`.  Well actually, we are telling the interpreter to point the variable `y` to precisely the same memory location as where `x` is.  So the total result of these two lines can be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x -> 139819098501312\n",
    "    y -> 139819098501312\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x = 13\n",
    "    y = x\n",

So now, `x` will point to a different location in memory, but the memory location of `y` will not have changed!  You might have thought that since `y = x` is essentially telling the interpreter to point `y` to the same location as `x`, that if the location of `x` changes, then the interpreter will \"remember\" to change the memory location of `y` accordinglingy, but that is not what happens.  The `y = x` statement tells the interpreter only to assign `y` to the *current* memory location of `x`, and if the memory location of `x` changes later, this does not affect the value of `y`.  To see this in action, try the code in the exercise followed by a print statement to identify the memory locations of both `x` and `y`:\n",

In the example above, in order for the print statement to be executed provided `x` is negative, the print statement needs to be indented by four spaces.  Additionally, the `if` statement and condition that comes after it must end with a colon.  If either the colon is not included, or the indendation is not appropriate, then the code won't run as desired.

Suppose, for example, that you want the interpreter to take the absolute value of an `int` or `float`.  Mathematically, the absolute value is defined as $|x| = x$ *if* $x\\geq 0$ and $-x$ *otherwise*.

For example, if you wanted to manually compute the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 by brute force addition, starting from 1 and adding 2 then adding 3 etc., this would take quite a while.  But for a computer, especially a modern computer, this is a piece of cake.  In order to do this sort of thing, it's often appropriate to use a \"loop\".  In python, there are two main kinds of loops that one might generally find useful: `for` loops, which tell python to repeat a certain code block according to a pre-specified list of steps, and `while` loops which tell puthon to repeat a code block as long as a certain condition evaluates to true.\n",
